# Image-Caption-Generator---Deep-Learning

This is a project based on Deep Learning Techniques (Convolutional Neural Network  &  Recurrent Neural Network), in which caption is generated for image which we will give as an input to our model.

Libraries used :
    1) Numpy
    2) OS
    3) Tensorflow (Keras)
    4) PIL
    
    
Tools used :
    1) Jupyter Notebook
    2) Pycharm IDE


Framework used :
    1) Django (for frontend)
